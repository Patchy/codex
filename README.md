# Patchy's codex fork

Soft fork of [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex). `main` mirrors
upstream; everything custom lives on the [`patchy`](../../tree/patchy) branch,
which tracks upstream continuously.

What's different here:

- **Live subagent panel** — running agents pinned above the composer with
  status, elapsed time, turn counts, and latest activity. Works with both
  multi-agent v1 and v2.
- **Agent dashboard** — `/panel` or `Alt+A` opens a full-screen view of every
  agent in the session with per-agent stats, live-refreshing.
- **Mouse support** — wheel scrolls overlays and (in alt-screen mode) the
  session; capture is scoped so inline mode keeps native terminal
  scrollback and selection.
- **Memory leak fix** — frees event buffers for closed background agents
  (upstream [#23260](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/23260); also on
  the [`upstream-mem-fix`](../../tree/upstream-mem-fix) branch as a clean
  single commit).
- **Working nix build** — upstream's flake is fixed: pinned toolchain from
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, corrected git-dep hashes, prebuilt V8 handling.

Install with nix:

```shell
nix run github:Patchy/codex/patchy
```

Or build from source (Rust 1.95+):

```shell
cargo build --release -p codex-cli --manifest-path codex-rs/Cargo.toml
```

Upstream's README follows.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Run the following on Mac or Linux to install Codex CLI:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

Run the following on Windows to install Codex CLI:

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The standalone installers download from `https://releases.openai.com/codex` by default and fall back to GitHub Releases if a metadata or asset download is unavailable. To force GitHub Releases, set `CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM` to `false` (`0` and `no` are also accepted):

```shell
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM=false sh
```

```powershell
$env:CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM='false'; irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex
```

Codex CLI can also be installed via the following package managers:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.
